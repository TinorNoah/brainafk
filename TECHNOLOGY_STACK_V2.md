# Nhost Stack (Unified Backend)
hasura:          # GraphQL engine + Auto-generated API
hasura-auth:     # Authentication service
hasura-storage:  # File storage service
minio:           # Object storage (internal to Nhost)
mailhog:         # Email service (development)

# Custom Services
go-backend:      # Go API server (specialized processing)
